-Module:
DLTX Minimod - Expanded Armor Pack [Jack-It]

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
NOTE: You need the original mod. Disable the gamedata/configs and the gamedata/textures/ui folder.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
Did some more spring cleaning in the files defining the outfits and their helmet HUDs. Nothing big, but some inconsistencies should be gone away, or replaced with others... (•̪ o •̪) Also some tweaks:

Nerfed PS5 outfits: all loner variants will share the same protection (both for player and NPCs) as the vanilla PS5 ones instead of Radsuits. The Scope outfit will also have the Sphere helmet head protection, and the Merc Wolfhound slightly higher body protection and the Exo helmet head protection.

Added the Ghost ISG Radsuit to the NPC spawn pool.

Fixed parts and loot files to include missing helmets and avoid redundancies.

All outfits are now sellable.

Trader redistribution: you'll find more loner traders selling the NBC and PS5 outfits, but the SKAT and Exosuit will be rarer. Clear Sky will also offer the Scar trenchcoat through high goodwill.

Icons grouped up for a more compact texture file. A couple icons also were larger than normal, so I squished them. Maybe someone will make proper icons one day...

Integration for 1st Person View and Grok's Stash Overhaul.

If you want extra functionality for this, my addons for Outfit Attachment Overhaul and Armor Modkits include patches for them.
