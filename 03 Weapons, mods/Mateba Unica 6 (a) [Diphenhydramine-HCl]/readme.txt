-Module:
Mateba Unica 6 [Diphenhydramine-HCl]

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
NOTE: You need the original mod. Disable the configs and anims folders.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
The original mod overwrites the MP412. I make it its own gun instead. Gave its own icon, and tweaked the firing effect for 3rd person view models.

Blacklisted the guns from the new 3D ballistics. Unfortunately, the model has wacko bones and shoots downward. I've tried to fix it but it's beyond my skill. If you know how to use Blender and how to fix bones and align them to be zeroed for the purpose of the 3D ballistics, any help is welcome.

Why not use Joseph Porta's instead? Well sure, I love it, but those models' number of materials add up and end up being murder on my potato. :_D

Integration for Grok's Stash Overhaul.

-Patches:
Speedloaders and ammo for revolvers. Adds another version chambered in .44, added to traders, npc loadouts, etc. Stats have been based a bit on Joseph Porta's Mateba but with some tweaks.
