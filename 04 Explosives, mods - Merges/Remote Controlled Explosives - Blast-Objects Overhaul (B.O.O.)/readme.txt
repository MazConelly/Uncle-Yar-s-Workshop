-Module:
Remote Controlled Explosives [chool] - Blast-Objects Overhaul (B.O.O.) [dubious-repute] merge

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
NOTE: Do not mix with the separated DLTXd files for either mod, also included in this patch pack.

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
The Remote IEDs integrated into BOO have been stripped away. This way you can still have the aggressive actions of BOO while keeping remote functionality, and we reduce our number of items in the game.

You must disable the configs and texture/ui from the original BOO. You must disable the configs folder from the original Remote Controlled Explosives. You may still use the patches included in the original Remote Controlled Explosives if you need them. 

----------------------------------------------------------
-Patches:
Anomalous Mines: Avoids crashes to desktop and allows you to plant anomalous IEDs as per Remote Controlled Explosives's features. Yes, even in someone's pockets. Must load after the original Remote Controlled Explosives, whether you use my DLTXd files or not.

It is compatible with the other explosives mods patches for B.O.O. included in this patch pack.
