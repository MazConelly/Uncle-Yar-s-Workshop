;Rebalancing ammo prices is also practical balance!

;9x21 could stand to cost a bit less. It costs twice the 5.7mm, coming from a closer country, and serves about the same number of guns, though its a bit rarer and it's an AP round, so let's make it in between the 9x39 FMJ and AP

; Standardized some guns to the rpm used in AN-94 Fire Rate Fix and More and Hellblau's fix, or just real life. The upgrades get some increased rates tho. (should they tho)
;tacticool variants become:
;Hand gun: base variant cost + 5k
;main gun: base variant cost + 10k
;heavy gun: base variant cost + 15k
;zone produced tax: +2500
;rarity or expensive tax: +5k
;If total is lower than the most expensive non special vanilla variant of the gun (ie: custom or modern), add another +5k.
;upgrade kits sum their price to the upgraded gun, in case you want to sell it to recover costs

;Saigas in particular:
;vanilla -> 20x70 -5k
;vanilla -> m1 +5k -> m2 +10k
;vanilla -> tactical +20k -> ISG +10k
;drums +7500
