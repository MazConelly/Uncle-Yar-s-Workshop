-Module:
Weapon stats fix and rebalance patch

----------------------------------------------------------
-Compatibility:
The vanilla file will also affect mods that reuse the same IDs. Both good and intended, though some incongruencies may happen if a particular weapon is changed into a different one, like Blackgrowl's Pretty Pistols Pack. They will be looked at.

Also, you know, modders should do their minimal research beforehand. You know who you are. ( ͡° ͜ʖ ͡°)

----------------------------------------------------------
-Explanation:
A holistic rebalance of the whole arsenal, using certain mods as stepping stones: HellblaueHoelle's Fire Rate Fix, Georg_Ravioli's AN-94 Fire Rate Fix, and Phosibl3's ReWeight Ammo among others.

It fixes the simplest aspect of weaponry by observing real life firearms. Broadly this means reduced range, in exchange of things like lower weight, higher fire rate and/or muzzle velocity. Or the other way around.

Usually fights in game happen at relatively short ranges. So while on the surface this may feel as an overall nerf judging by the reach of your shots, and it may make approaching the CNNP harder thou, I think it ends up more as a buff.

Bottom line, if you want to snipe, you better go get a proper sniper rifle.

There are patches intended for different packs; individual mods are grouped up in the same file. All of them are modified up to the same standards in the main module.


Highlights are:

-Pistols: fire distance down to an average-ish of 75-150 meters, caliber depending.
Pistols are strictly close range, not for sniping, but big calibers will reach the furthest out of sheer force. 9x18 are squirt guns.


-SMGs: fire distance down to an average-ish of 150-250 meters, caliber depending.
The heavier the caliber, the sooner they drop. Should still be fine for close range and mutant hunting.
PP-SH reclassified as SMG, not assault rifle.


-5.7mm weapons: reduced range and muzzle velocity of the P90 and FN57 in favor of fire rate. The P90 will reach about 400 meters.


-5.56mm weapons: fire distance down to average of 500 meters, weapon type and family depending.
M249 and RPK can still reach 800, but hopefully we won't see any silly sniping.


-9x39 weapons: fire distance down to average of 400 meters.
These are intended for clandestine close quarters assault. Sniping a dude up a tower is one thing, across a football field another.


-12.7mm weapons:
Ash-12 and VSSK fire distance down to 300 and 800 meters, respectively. Ash-12 gets a heavy damage buff to compensate.
12.7 ammo is sort of an .50 analogue, with the Ash-12 being used as 9x39 cranked up to eleven, and the VSSK an anti materiel rifle. You usually use those on armor, not on a fleshy target across kilometers.


-Shotguns:
Range reduced, compensated in some cases by lower weight or higher fire rate (most are pump or breech loaders anyway).
Given both buckshot and slugs follow the same range per gun, we will follow these rules. Hopefully those ranges are enough for your slugs. Do tell your impressions.:
	Sawn offs breech loaders: 50 meters
	Full length breech loaders: 125 meters
	The rest (magazine, pump, etc): 100 meters
	Slug only (ie TOZ Bull, Bizon): breach 175, others 150
	Some justified exceptions, mostly from mods and depending on barrel extensions or shortenings, can get more or less, but they're few.

Mossberg 590A1. Increased load by 1.

All Saigas, included from other mods in their patches below, nerfed across the board, with all available ones offering a progression of sorts. The BaS ISG and Tactical's models look like a Komrad, a shorter barreled Saiga variant, so I keep that in mind.
On a first tier, Saiga 12 and 20 work as caliber alternatives.
A second tier is started by the BaS Saiga Eco, and improved by the BaS Saiga Merc.
On a third tier, you start with the Saiga Tactical is better than them but heavier and suffers from worse range. The BaS Saiga ISG improves upon the Tactical and recovers some range, but it's the heaviest.
MWP's bullpup Saiga stays in a 2.5 tier, with very good performance compared to the BaS ISG. A bit of extra range makes it the better to slug snipe with, though that's not saying a lot.
Applying the drum kits is also nerfed; smaller improvements, but over more aspects and weight won't be increased (the extra ammo already does that), to allow a given Saiga to catch up with the next ones, but at a far more moderate pace.
With these tweaks, a drummed vanilla Saiga will be like a untweaked BaS Merc, and a drummed Saiga ISG would reach close to the untweaked Saiga ISG.


-Snipers:
Karabiner 98 Kurz: Reduced range from 1100 meters to 1000.
Mosin Nagant: Raised weight a bit and reduced firing range from 1100 meters to 1000, while raising muzzle velocity from 845 m/s to 865.


-LMGs:
PKM: fire rate raised to 700.


PENDING: 7.xmm weapons, snipers, and LMGs in general, .


----------------------------------------------------------
-Patches:

All changes follows the same balancing ideas as the file for vanilla guns. The files have plenty of comments for further insights on changes.

-Boomsticks and Sharpsticks.
This includes guns from BaS itself and explicit addons such as BaS Extra Weapons, Saiga drum kit, and BaS Plus Saiga Tactical.

Ammo price and weight
9x21 (includes the variants in CXV's mod) is still expensive, but less than before, and weighs a bit less than half.
23x75 is thrice more expensive, to make you hesitate pulling the KS23 out.
.338 Federal gets a tiny 100 shaved off, and weights a quarter than before.
Vog-30 costs twice as the Vog-25.

Weapon prices
Start with the price of each gun. Add +5k for tacticool pistol variant, +10k if main gun, +15k if heavy. +5k for rarity, and +5k for Zone produced.
Some particular guns have their own increases, others receive a -5k if they're a inferior variant.
Upgraded weapons simply add the price of the upgrade kit.
Expensive weapons end up cheaper, particularly those with stupid high prices, while cheap weapons do not suffer much variance. You're also able to recoup some of the money spent on an used upgrade.

23x75 shotguns
raised prices +10k, and nerfed damage, muzzle velocity and rate of fire of weapons slightly. To compensate, the basic KS23 gets its range buffed to 150 meters.

M4 rifles
Nerfed damange and push to that of the vanilla M4 and M4A1, for consistency.

Saiga 20
Will now use a vanilla silencer like the vanilla Saiga 12.

Some further notes:
Billwa's Izh-18 & MP18: adapted changes made by Meylin in the Anomaly Discord. Izh-18 more accurate than double barrel shotguns. Both guns slightly more damaging, further reaching, and harder to break.
JMerc's Arbiter Pack: range nerfed for all guns (a silenced revolver capping targets at 610 meters? Get serious), and hit push halved for Bushmaster (it's only half an AR-15 rifle, not a SVD or something like that).
Pillii's Honeybadger: range reduced to 400 meters, similar to 9x39 guns.
Soulcrystal's Arisaka Quality Control. Touched the muzzle velocity down a bit, and firerate up another bit. Very small bits, mind you. I was going to nerf the range but then I've read about being able to reach 1500~ in real life and [HESITATION].
Soulcrystal's Benelli M4: range nerfed from 1000 (!) to 100, now uses NATO silencer for vanilla compatibility.
